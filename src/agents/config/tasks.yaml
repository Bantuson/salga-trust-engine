# tasks.yaml — Task template definitions
# Architecture: Flow-as-router + sequential specialist Crews (Phase 10.3 rebuild)
#
# Structure per task:
#   <task_key>:
#     description: str   (may contain {placeholder} variables filled by context dict)
#     expected_output: str
#
# Note on description fields:
#   Most specialist tasks generate their description dynamically from Python prompt
#   modules (build_auth_task_description, build_municipal_task_description, etc.)
#   The description field here is a placeholder only.

auth_task:
  description: "Generated dynamically by build_auth_task_description() in src/agents/prompts/auth.py"
  expected_output: "A warm, helpful response guiding the citizen through authentication"

municipal_intake_task:
  description: "Generated dynamically by build_municipal_task_description() in src/agents/prompts/municipal.py"
  expected_output: "A warm, helpful response collecting issue details or confirming ticket creation with tracking number"

  description: "Generated dynamically by build_ticket_status_task_description() in src/agents/prompts/ticket_status.py"
