# tasks.yaml — Task template definitions
# Architecture: Flow-as-router + sequential specialist Crews (Phase 10.3 rebuild)
#
# Structure per task:
#   <task_key>:
#     description: str   (may contain {placeholder} variables filled by context dict)
#     expected_output: str
#
# Note on auth_task description:
#   The description field below is a placeholder only.
#   AuthCrew.build_task_description() calls build_auth_task_description(context)
#   from src/agents/prompts/auth.py to generate the full task description at
#   runtime (per-request, per-language, per-user-state).

auth_task:
  description: "Generated dynamically by build_auth_task_description() in src/agents/prompts/auth.py"
  expected_output: "A warm, helpful response guiding the citizen through authentication"

# --- Plans 04-07: additional tasks added here as agents are rebuilt ---
