# agents.yaml — Agent persona definitions
# Architecture: Flow-as-router + sequential specialist Crews (Phase 10.3 rebuild)
#
# Structure per agent:
#   <agent_key>:
#     role: str
#     goal: str  (may contain {language} placeholder)
#     backstory: str           # English (or note: "Set at runtime from AUTH_PROMPTS")
#     backstory_zu: str        # isiZulu (optional)
#     backstory_af: str        # Afrikaans (optional)
#     allow_delegation: bool   # Always False for specialists
#     max_iter: int
#     verbose: bool
#
# Note on auth_agent backstory:
#   The backstory field below is a placeholder only.
#   AuthCrew.create_crew() injects the full Gugu persona from
#   src/agents/prompts/auth.py AUTH_PROMPTS[language] at runtime.
#   This avoids duplicating 200+ lines of trilingual prompt content in YAML.

auth_agent:
  role: "Citizen Authentication Assistant"
  goal: "Help citizens register or log in to SALGA Trust Engine"
  backstory: "Selected per language at runtime from AUTH_PROMPTS in src/agents/prompts/auth.py"
  allow_delegation: false
  max_iter: 15
  verbose: false
