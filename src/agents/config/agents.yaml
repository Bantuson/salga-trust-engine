# agents.yaml — Agent persona definitions
# Architecture: Flow-as-router + sequential specialist Crews (Phase 10.3 rebuild)
#
# Structure per agent:
#   <agent_key>:
#     role: str
#     goal: str  (may contain {language} placeholder)
#     backstory: str           # English (or note: "Set at runtime from *_PROMPTS")
#     backstory_zu: str        # isiZulu (optional)
#     backstory_af: str        # Afrikaans (optional)
#     allow_delegation: bool   # Always False for specialists
#     max_iter: int
#     verbose: bool
#
# Note on backstory fields:
#   Most specialist agents inject their backstory from Python prompt modules
#   (src/agents/prompts/auth.py, municipal.py, ticket_status.py, etc.) at
#   runtime. The backstory field here is a placeholder only.
