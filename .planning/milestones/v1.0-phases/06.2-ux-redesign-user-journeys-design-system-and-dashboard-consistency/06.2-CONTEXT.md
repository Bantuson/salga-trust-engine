# Phase 6.2: UX Redesign — User Journeys, Design System & Dashboard Consistency - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Redesign both dashboards (municipal + public) with properly defined user journeys, a consistent design system, complete registration/onboarding flows, page structure separation (transparency dashboard as dedicated page), and improved 3D elements. This phase addresses critical UI/UX gaps identified after Phase 6.1 execution. No new backend functionality — this is frontend design and implementation refinement.

**Design process guidance (from user's reference screenshots):**
1. Discovery & Kickoff — ask questions (done via this discussion)
2. Strategy & Scope — IA, sitemaps, user flows
3. (Wireframing implied)
4. Design (high-fi) — design system, high-fidelity mockups, prototype
5. Review & Final Approval — walkthrough, sign-off
6. Hand-off prep — clean up, finalize design system
7. Handoff package — organized deliverables

**No direct SALGA contact available** — must rely on research to define and design.

## Implementation Decisions

### User Journeys & Flows

**Municipality registration: Hybrid model**
- Municipality requests access via a web form (name, province, contact details, supporting documents)
- SALGA platform admin reviews and approves/rejects the request
- On approval, municipality admin receives invite to complete setup

**Municipality onboarding: Guided wizard**
- Step-by-step wizard after first login: set up profile → invite team members → configure wards → set SLA targets → done
- Progress tracked, can be resumed if interrupted

**Citizen registration: Web + WhatsApp unified**
- Register via web form (email/phone, ID, proof of residence upload for OCR verification)
- WhatsApp users guided through same steps via chat conversation
- Both flows result in the same verified account bound to a specific municipality

**Personas: 2 primary + role-based variants**
- **Citizen journey**: Registration → Proof of residence → Report issue → Track progress → View personal stats
- **Municipal staff journey**: Login → Role-adaptive dashboard with variants for:
  - Manager: full view (tickets, teams, analytics, settings, SLA)
  - Ward Councillor: ward-filtered view
  - Field Worker: assigned tickets only
  - SAPS Liaison: GBV cases only
  - Platform Admin: cross-tenant management

**Citizen authenticated web portal features:**
- "My Reports" dashboard: list of reported tickets with status indicators (open, in progress, resolved)
- Prominent "Report New Issue" button
- Personal analytics: total reports, resolved count, average resolution time, comparison to municipality average
- Unified ticket list with privacy flag: municipal tickets show full detail (team, progress, photos), GBV tickets have lock icon showing limited info (status + assigned SAPS officer name + station phone number)

**GBV case visibility for citizens:**
- Citizens see case status + assigned SAPS officer name and station phone number
- Enables victim to follow up directly with police
- Emergency contacts (10111, 0800 150 150) always prominently displayed

**Transparency Dashboard (public, unauthenticated):**
- First view: Interactive SA map showing all participating municipalities
- Click a municipality to drill into its data (click-to-expand panels pattern)
- Progressive disclosure: high-level cards expand inline with charts and details — no page navigation
- Features: municipality side-by-side comparison + ranked leaderboard
- Full interactive heatmap: zoom, pan, click clusters for category breakdown, time filter slider, toggle by issue type

### Page Structure & Information Architecture

**Public site: 4 pages**
1. **Landing page** — marketing/brand, hero with CTA "View Municipal Performance" button linking to dashboard
2. **Transparency Dashboard** — separate dedicated page (NOT embedded in landing)
3. **Report an Issue** — redirects to municipal dashboard login (citizens must authenticate)
4. **About / How It Works** — explains SALGA Trust Engine, process, benefits

**Public site navigation:**
- Transparent header overlaying hero content, solidifies on scroll
- Logo left, nav links, "Report Issue" CTA button
- Mobile: hamburger menu

**Municipal dashboard: Role-adaptive layout**
- Icon-only sidebar by default, hover/click expands to show labels
- Nav items change by role (Manager sees all, Councillor sees ward view, etc.)
- Pages: Login → Register → Onboarding Wizard → Dashboard (metrics) → Tickets → Teams → Settings → Analytics

**Landing → Dashboard connection:**
- Hero CTA button: prominent "View Municipal Performance" button in landing hero section
- Clear visual separation — landing is marketing/brand, dashboard is data

**Report flow:**
- Report button on public site redirects to municipal dashboard login
- After authentication, citizens submit full reports via municipal dashboard

### Design System & Visual Identity

**Brand direction: Modern civic tech + subtle SA heritage**
- Approachable but professional
- Dark mode with vibrant accents
- South African heritage elements as subtle decorative accents (not prominent)
- Geometric border patterns, Ndebele/Zulu-inspired shapes as section dividers and decorative backgrounds

**Color palette:**
- Dark base: animated gradient background that rotates through 3 different gradient color schemes (not static navy)
- Keep coral (#FF6B4A) and teal (#00D9A6) as accent colors
- Gradient animation should be smooth and subtle, not distracting

**Signature component: Glassmorphism cards**
- Municipal dashboard login card design is loved — make this a reusable card component
- Frosted glass effect: translucent backgrounds, blur, subtle borders
- Use glassmorphism cards wherever appropriate across both dashboards

**Components: Full premium treatment**
- Glassmorphism cards as signature component
- Polished micro-interactions on all interactive elements
- Hover reveals, smooth transitions, skeleton loaders, progress indicators
- All components designed with: Default, Hover, Focus, Disabled states

**Typography: Distinctive heading font**
- Unique display/geometric font for headings paired with clean body font
- Research appropriate font pairing that matches SA civic tech + heritage direction

**SA heritage elements: Subtle accents**
- Geometric border patterns on section dividers
- Ndebele/Zulu-inspired shapes as decorative elements (backgrounds, not foreground)
- Background textures where appropriate

**Shared design system across both dashboards:**
- Same component library, same visual language
- Both apps use identical components, colors, typography
- One brand, one system

### 3D Elements & Animations

**Current 3D problem: Too basic/low quality**
- Current 3D globe and elements look amateur
- Need significantly higher fidelity

**3D globe purpose: Interactive data visualization**
- Not just eye candy — the globe IS the data visualization entry point
- Globe shows municipality locations, click to select, data overlays
- Functional tool, not just decoration

**3D placement: Landing page + transparency dashboard**
- 3D globe on landing hero (stylized premium, draws attention)
- Same globe asset reused on transparency dashboard as interactive map
- Municipal dashboard uses 2D maps and charts (no 3D)

**3D quality: Stylized premium**
- Clean geometric South Africa with province outlines
- Custom materials (metallic/glass effects)
- Particle effects, glowing data points for municipalities
- Artistic, not photorealistic — matches the glassmorphism aesthetic

**Scroll animations: Cinematic scroll storytelling**
- Full GSAP scroll-triggered sections with parallax
- Reveal animations, counter animations, section transitions
- Landing page is an experience, not just a page
- Must respect prefers-reduced-motion for accessibility

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact gradient color schemes for the rotating dark base animation
- Specific font pairing selection (research best match for SA civic tech)
- Specific Ndebele/Zulu geometric patterns to use as decorative accents
- 3D globe material and lighting specifics
- Skeleton loader designs
- Exact GSAP animation timing curves and sequences
- Mobile breakpoint-specific adaptations
- Loading states and error states visual design

## Specific Ideas

- "I love the municipal dashboard login card component design — it should be reusable for cards where appropriate" (glassmorphism reference)
- Dark base should be animated gradient shifting between 3 color schemes, not static navy
- Transparency Dashboard must be a separate page from landing, accessed via hero CTA button
- Follow the 7-phase design process loosely (discovery → strategy → wireframes → high-fi → review → handoff prep → handoff)
- No direct SALGA contact — rely on research for South African municipal context
- SA heritage patterns should be subtle/decorative, not overwhelming
- Heatmap needs full interactivity: zoom, pan, click clusters, time filter, category toggle
- Municipality comparison: both side-by-side AND ranked leaderboard features

## Deferred Ideas

- SMS/USSD channel for citizens without smartphones — future phase
- Offline field worker mobile app — deferred to v2
- Real-time chat between citizen and assigned municipal worker — future phase
- Multi-language dashboard UI (currently English-only dashboard, trilingual WhatsApp/API) — future phase
- Spending transparency on public dashboard — deferred per PROJECT.md
