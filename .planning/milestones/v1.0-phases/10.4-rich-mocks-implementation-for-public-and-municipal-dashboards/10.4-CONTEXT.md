# Phase 10.4: Rich Mocks Implementation for Public and Municipal Dashboards - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-27
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Replace placeholder/skeleton content across both dashboards (frontend-dashboard and frontend-public) with realistic mock data so the app looks and feels production-ready. Populated tables, charts with real-looking numbers, filled cards, meaningful status distributions. This is about making what's already built look alive with convincing South African municipal data — not adding new features or pages.

## Implementation Decisions

### Data Realism
- Fully authentic SA data: real municipality names (eThekwini, Mangaung, Buffalo City, etc.), real ward numbers, culturally authentic citizen names (Zulu, Afrikaans, English mix — e.g., Sipho Ndlovu, Pieter van der Merwe, Nomsa Khumalo)
- Real SA municipal issues for ticket descriptions: potholes, water outages, streetlight failures, sewage overflows, billing disputes — instantly relatable for municipal audiences
- Mixed trilingual ticket descriptions: some in isiZulu ("Amanzi awekho eWard 12"), some in Afrikaans ("Straatlig is stukkend"), most in English — shows trilingual capability naturally
- GBV-related mock tickets included, visible only to SAPS liaison/admin roles — demonstrates SEC-05 firewall in action
- Recent timestamps only (last few days) — system feels active and alive
- ~30-40 mock users across all 6 roles (citizen, manager, admin, field_worker, saps_liaison, ward_councillor) — shows scale
- Initial-based avatars (colored circles with initials: "SN", "PvdM") — clean, no licensing concerns

### Data Storage
- Frontend mock files (JSON/TS) imported by components — no backend dependency
- Can swap to real API later without changing component interfaces

### Visual Density
- Manageable ticket volumes (~15-25 tickets) in municipal dashboard — enough to demo filtering/sorting without overwhelming
- Optimistic status distribution: ~15% open, ~20% in progress, ~5% escalated, ~50% resolved, ~10% closed — system working well
- Public transparency dashboard: active and transparent — multiple recent resolutions, ward-level breakdowns, satisfaction scores visible
- Every page populated — no empty states anywhere. System feels fully alive.

### Charts & Metrics
- Improvement arc narrative: trends going up (resolution rate improving, response time decreasing, citizen satisfaction climbing) — platform is making a difference
- Municipal dashboard KPIs: service delivery focused — average resolution time, SLA compliance %, tickets resolved today, citizen satisfaction score
- Public transparency dashboard: trust-building metrics — average response time, % issues resolved, satisfaction ratings, ward-level performance comparisons
- Default time range: last 30 days for all charts

### Page Coverage
- All pages get rich mocks equally — no page left as an afterthought
- **Municipal dashboard:** Dashboard (home), Ticket List, Analytics, Teams, Settings, Completed Tickets, Field Worker Tickets, SAPS Reports, Onboarding Wizard
- **Public dashboard:** Landing, Transparency Dashboard, Citizen Portal (with 3-5 past tickets showing status updates and resolution notes), Report Issue, About, Profile
- Settings shows real config options, Teams shows actual team members with roles
- SAPS Reports page shows anonymized GBV case data with sensitive but non-graphic descriptions — demonstrates SEC-05 security firewall working
- Citizen portal shows full citizen experience: past ticket history with statuses, timestamps, and resolution notes

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact mock data file structure and naming conventions
- Chart library and visualization approach
- Specific avatar color palette
- How mock data modules export/import across components
- Exact number of data points per chart for the 30-day range

## Specific Ideas

- Municipality names should be real: eThekwini, Mangaung, Buffalo City, Nelson Mandela Bay, etc.
- Citizen names should reflect SA demographics: Sipho Ndlovu, Nomsa Khumalo, Pieter van der Merwe, Fatima Adams, etc.
- Ticket descriptions should be immediately relatable: "Pothole on N2 near Ward 34 entrance", "Water outage since Monday — whole street affected", "Streetlight out on Main Rd opposite the school"
- isiZulu example: "Amanzi awekho eWard 12" (No water in Ward 12)
- Afrikaans example: "Straatlig is stukkend op Hoofweg" (Streetlight is broken on Main Road)
- GBV entries should be sensitively worded — case references, not graphic descriptions
- The improvement arc in charts should show clear positive trajectory to tell a "platform is working" story
