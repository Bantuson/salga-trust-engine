<objective>
Enhance the municipal dashboard login page with product info and branding.

Purpose: Per user decision, the login page stays as the entry point (no separate landing page). This plan enhances it with a description of what the municipal dashboard offers, making it informative for first-time visitors who may not know what SALGA Trust Engine is. "Sign In" and "Request Access" buttons both stay visible.

Output: Enhanced LoginPage.tsx with product information section alongside the existing login form.

  <name>Task 1: Add product info section to municipal dashboard login page</name>

  </files>
  <action>
    Enhance `frontend-dashboard/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx` to include a product information section alongside the existing glassmorphic login card.

    The current login page has: skyline background, glassmorphic card with login form positioned right-of-center (`marginRight: '10%'`).

    **Layout change:** Convert the container to a two-column layout on desktop:
    - Left side: Product info section (visible on desktop, hidden on mobile)
    - Right side: Existing login card (unchanged functionality)

    **Product info section (new):**
    Add a div with className "login-product-info" positioned on the left side (z-index: 2, relative positioning). Content:

    1. **Tagline:** "Municipal Service Management" in large text with gradient (coral -> teal)
    2. **Description paragraph:** "Manage citizen reports, track service delivery, and monitor municipal performance in real time. AI-powered routing, SLA tracking, and automated escalation ensure no issue falls through the cracks."
    3. **Feature list (3-4 bullet points with icons):**
       - "Real-time ticket management and assignment"
       - "SLA compliance monitoring with auto-escalation"
       - "Team workload analytics and performance tracking"
       - "Citizen communication via WhatsApp integration"
    4. **Request Access CTA:** A secondary styled link to /request-access: "Are you a municipality? Request access to get started."

    **Styling approach:**
    - Product info section: `position: relative`, `zIndex: 2`, `maxWidth: 480px`, white/light text (readable against skyline), `marginLeft: '10%'`
    - Feature list items: small teal checkmark icon + text, stacked vertically with 0.75rem gap
    - On mobile (< 768px): Hide product info section entirely, login card centers as before
    - Use inline styles (matching existing component pattern) with a media query comment noting responsive behavior

    **GSAP animation (optional enhancement):**
    In the existing useGSAP timeline, add the product info section as part of the staggered entrance:
    - Add a ref for the product info section
    - Add it to the timeline BEFORE the card animation:
      ```
      tl.from(productInfoRef.current, { x: -30, opacity: 0, duration: 0.6, ease: 'power2.out' });
      ```

    **IMPORTANT:** Do NOT change any existing login form functionality. The email/password form, phone OTP flow, register link, and request access link all stay exactly as-is. The "Don't have an account?" + "Create Account" and "Are you a municipality?" + "Request Access" links at the bottom of the login card REMAIN — the product info section provides an additional, more prominent CTA for request access.

    **Container layout update:**
    Change the container from `alignItems: 'center'` + `justifyContent: 'center'` to a flex row:
    ```
    display: 'flex',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'space-between',
    padding: '0 5%',
    ```

    On mobile, revert to centered single-column layout. Add a CSS class or use a simple media query approach. Since existing code uses inline styles, add a `@media` rule in App.css for `.login-container` responsiveness, OR use a simpler approach: keep the login card's existing `marginRight: '10%'` for desktop and let the product info section show/hide via CSS.

    Simplest approach: Add a `login-product-info` className to the info section and in `frontend-dashboard/src/App.css`, add:
    ```css
    @media (max-width: 768px) {
      .login-product-info { display: none; }
    }
    ```
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `cd frontend-dashboard && npx tsc --noEmit` to verify TypeScript compiles.
    Verify LoginPage.tsx contains product info section with feature list.
    Verify "Request Access" text appears in the product info section.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Municipal dashboard login page displays product info/branding on the left side, describing real-time ticket management, SLA monitoring, team analytics, and WhatsApp integration. Sign In form and Request Access link are both prominently visible. Mobile view hides the info section and shows just the login card.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `cd frontend-dashboard && npx tsc --noEmit` — TypeScript compiles with zero errors
2. LoginPage.tsx has product info section with at least 3 feature bullet points
3. Request Access link visible in product info section
4. Existing login form functionality unchanged (email, phone OTP, register, request access links)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Login page has product info section describing the municipal dashboard
- Sign In and Request Access are both prominently visible
- Existing auth functionality preserved (email+password, phone OTP, register)
- Mobile responsive (info section hidden, card centered)
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/06.4-dashboard-landing-pages-public-hero-polish-and-citizen-auth-architecture-on-public-portal/06.4-03-SUMMARY.md`
