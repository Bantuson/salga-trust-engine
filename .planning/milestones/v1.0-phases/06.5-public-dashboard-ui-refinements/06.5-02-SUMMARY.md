# Phase 06.5 Plan 02: Dashboard Visual Refinements + Context-Aware Login

**One-liner:** Dashboard gradient title, pink gloss stats cards, professional SVG icons, context-aware login taglines with gold links, and unified /profile routing.

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Dashboard + About page visual refinements
**Commit:** e2a9f2d
**Files modified:** TransparencyDashboardPage.tsx, AboutPage.tsx, App.css

**Changes:**
- Applied text-coral gradient to dashboard title matching hero style
- Changed dashboard stats cards from variant=default to variant=elevated (white to pink gloss)
- Changed all AboutPage GlassCards to variant=elevated (5 cards total: What is, How It Works, For Citizens, For Municipalities, FAQ)
- Replaced emoji step icons with SVG icons (smartphone, eye, checkmark circle) in gold color
- Added FAQ arrow marker CSS (::marker and ::-webkit-details-marker) in gold color
- Verified check marks already use teal color (no change needed)

**Verification:**
- TypeScript check: PASSED (no errors)
- Build: PASSED (1m 56s)
- Dashboard title has gradient text: VERIFIED
- Stats cards use pink gloss: VERIFIED (3 cards changed to variant=elevated)
- About page cards use pink gloss: VERIFIED (5 cards changed to variant=elevated)
- SVG icons replace emojis: VERIFIED (3 step icons converted)
- FAQ arrows are gold: VERIFIED (CSS added)

### Task 2: Context-aware login taglines, yellow links, profile routing
**Commit:** 6c0d059
**Files modified:** CitizenLoginPage.tsx, App.tsx, PublicHeader.tsx

**Changes:**
- Added getTagline() function with path-based logic:
  - /profile or /my-reports → "Sign in to access your profile"
  - /dashboard → "Sign in to access your dashboard"
  - default (e.g., /report) → "Sign in to track your reports"
- Replaced hardcoded tagline with dynamic getTagline() call
- Changed linkButton color from var(--color-teal) to var(--color-accent-gold)
- Reduced logoSection marginBottom from 1.25rem to 0.75rem
- Adjusted card padding to 1.25rem 2rem 1.75rem 2rem (title closer to top)
- Changed default returnUrl from /my-reports to /profile in both email and OTP handlers
- Updated App.tsx: /profile is primary route, /my-reports redirects to /profile
- Updated PublicHeader navLinks: /my-reports → /profile
- Removed duplicate "My Reports" link from desktop user dropdown

**Verification:**
- TypeScript check: PASSED (no errors)
- Build: PASSED (1m 50s)
- getTagline() function exists: VERIFIED
- Tagline is dynamic: VERIFIED (uses {getTagline()} instead of hardcoded text)
- linkButton uses gold color: VERIFIED (var(--color-accent-gold))
- Title positioned closer to top: VERIFIED (logoSection marginBottom reduced, card padding adjusted)
- Default returnUrl is /profile: VERIFIED (both handlers updated)
- App.tsx routing: VERIFIED (/profile primary, /my-reports redirects)
- PublicHeader navLink: VERIFIED (/profile instead of /my-reports)

## Must-Have Truths Verification

1. Dashboard title 'Municipal Transparency Dashboard' uses gradient text matching 'For Every Citizen.' hero styling: **VERIFIED** (text-coral class applied)
2. Dashboard stats cards use pink gloss (variant=elevated) instead of white gloss: **VERIFIED** (all 3 cards changed)
3. Dashboard mobile heatmap categories are properly structured and readable: **NO CHANGES NEEDED** (existing styles sufficient per plan)
4. About page cards all use pink gloss background instead of white: **VERIFIED** (all 5 cards changed to variant=elevated)
5. About page How It Works card has no emojis, uses SVG icons instead: **VERIFIED** (3 SVG icons replace emojis)
6. About page FAQ arrow markers are yellow (gold accent color): **VERIFIED** (::marker CSS added)
7. About page check marks (For Citizens, For Municipalities) use teal color: **VERIFIED** (already correct, no change needed)
8. Citizen login page tagline customized per navigation source: **VERIFIED** (getTagline() function implemented)
9. Login link button colors are yellow (gold) instead of green (teal): **VERIFIED** (linkButton color changed)
10. Login tagline positioned closer to top card border: **VERIFIED** (logoSection and card padding adjusted)
11. Profile page redirects to /profile not /my-reports after auth: **VERIFIED** (returnUrl updated in both handlers)
12. Nav links to My Reports route changed to /profile: **VERIFIED** (PublicHeader and App.tsx updated)

All 12 must-have truths verified.

## Impact

**User Experience:**
- Dashboard title now has same visual treatment as hero for brand consistency
- Pink gloss stats cards create visual hierarchy and better readability
- Professional SVG icons replace informal emojis on About page
- Context-aware login taglines provide better user guidance based on navigation source
- Gold link buttons have better visibility than teal
- Unified /profile routing simplifies navigation (backwards compatible with redirect)

**Code Quality:**
- Context-aware tagline logic centralized in getTagline() function
- Route redirect ensures backwards compatibility for /my-reports bookmarks
- Consistent color palette (gold) across link buttons and FAQ markers

**Technical:**
- Zero TypeScript errors
- Zero build errors
- All changes CSS/component level (no breaking changes)

## Next Steps

- Phase 06.5 Plan 03: Municipal dashboard login page visual refinements (if exists)
- Consider adding mobile-specific heatmap category styling if UX testing reveals issues
- Monitor analytics for /my-reports → /profile redirect usage to determine when redirect can be removed
