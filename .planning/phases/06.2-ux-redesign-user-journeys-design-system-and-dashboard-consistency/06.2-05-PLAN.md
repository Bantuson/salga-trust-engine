<objective>
Build the municipality registration flow (hybrid request access model) and guided onboarding wizard (5 steps: profile, invite team, configure wards, set SLA, done) with progress tracking.

Purpose: New municipalities need a controlled registration process (request access -> admin approval -> invite) and a guided setup wizard so they can configure their account without feeling overwhelmed. This is a locked decision: hybrid registration model + guided wizard.

Output: RequestAccessPage for new municipalities, OnboardingWizardPage with 5 step components and progress bar.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create municipality request access page and route</name>
  <files>
    frontend-dashboard/src/pages/RequestAccessPage.tsx
    frontend-dashboard/src/App.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    **1. Create RequestAccessPage.tsx:**
    This page is for municipalities that want to join the platform. It's NOT a signup form — it's an access request that goes through admin approval.

    **Layout:**
    - Same visual treatment as Login/Register pages (AnimatedGradientBg + GlassCard)
    - Title: "Request Municipal Access"
    - Subtitle: "Join the SALGA Trust Engine platform. Your request will be reviewed by our team."

    **Form fields:**
    - Municipality Name (required text input)
    - Province (required select dropdown — official SA provinces: Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, North West, Northern Cape, Western Cape)
    - Municipality Code (text input, auto-uppercase, e.g. "JHB", "CPT")
    - Contact Person Name (required text input)
    - Contact Email (required email input)
    - Contact Phone (phone input)
    - Supporting Documents (file upload area — "Upload documentation proving municipal authority")
    - Additional Notes (optional textarea)

    **Submit behavior:**
    - Since we don't have a backend endpoint for access requests yet, submit should:
      1. Validate all required fields
      2. Show a success state: GlassCard with check icon, message "Thank you for your request! Our team will review it and contact you within 5 business days. You'll receive an email invitation once approved."
      3. Store form data in localStorage as backup (key: `salga_access_request_draft`)
    - NOTE: The actual backend for processing access requests is deferred to a future phase. This plan creates the UI only.

    **Supporting document upload:**
    - Use the existing FileUpload component pattern if available, or create a simple file input with drag-and-drop area
    - Accept: PDF, JPG, PNG (max 10MB each, max 3 files)
    - Show uploaded file names with remove buttons
    - Files are NOT actually uploaded anywhere (no backend endpoint) — just show UI state

    **Navigation:**
    - Link at bottom: "Already have an invite? [Sign In]" → /login
    - Link: "Already have an account? [Sign In]" → /login

    **Use shared components:** GlassCard, Button, Input, AnimatedGradientBg

    **2. Add route in App.tsx:**
    - Add route: `/request-access` → RequestAccessPage (unauthenticated only)
    - Add link from LoginPage: "Municipality? [Request Access]" → /request-access

    **3. Update LoginPage.tsx:**
    - Add a small link below the register link: "Are you a municipality? [Request Access →]"
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `ls frontend-dashboard/src/pages/RequestAccessPage.tsx` — page exists
    - `grep "Request.*Access\|request-access" frontend-dashboard/src/App.tsx` — route exists
    - `grep "Province\|province" frontend-dashboard/src/pages/RequestAccessPage.tsx` — province dropdown exists
    - `grep "request-access\|Request Access" frontend-dashboard/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx` — link from login
    - `cd frontend-dashboard && npx tsc --noEmit` — TypeScript compiles
  </verify>
  <done>
    Municipality request access page created with form for name, province, code, contact info, and supporting documents. Submit shows confirmation. Login page links to request access. Route configured.

    frontend-dashboard/src/App.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    **1. Create OnboardingWizardPage.tsx:**
    - Full-screen page with AnimatedGradientBg background
    - GlassCard container for wizard content
    - State management: `currentStep` (0-5), `wizardData` (accumulates data from each step)
    - Steps array:
      ```
      0: Welcome (not counted in progress)
      1: Profile Setup (25%)
      2: Invite Team (50%)
      3: Configure Wards (75%)
      4: Set SLA Targets (100%)
      5: Done! (completion)
      ```
    - Navigation buttons: "Back" (ghost variant) + "Next" (primary variant)
    - "Skip" button available on steps 2, 3, 4 (optional steps) — advances without saving
    - Step 1 (Profile) is NOT skippable
    - Wizard data persisted to localStorage on each step change: `salga_onboarding_${userId}`
    - On mount, check localStorage for existing progress and resume from last step
    - On completion (step 5), clear localStorage

    **2. Create WizardProgress.tsx:**
    - Visual progress indicator at top of wizard
    - Shows step numbers 1-5 in circles connected by lines
    - Current step: coral circle with pulse animation
    - Completed steps: teal circle with check icon
    - Upcoming steps: muted gray circle
    - Progress percentage text: "Step 2 of 5 — 40%"
    - Below circles: step titles (Profile, Team, Wards, SLA, Done)
    - Responsive: on mobile, hide step titles, show only circles and percentage

    **3. Create WelcomeStep.tsx (Step 0):**
    - Welcome message: "Welcome to SALGA Trust Engine!"
    - Brief intro: "Let's get your municipality set up. This takes about 5 minutes."
    - Three icons showing what they'll configure: Profile, Team, Settings
    - Single CTA: "Start Setup" button
    - Optional: simple GSAP fade-in animation (check useReducedMotion)

    **4. Create ProfileStep.tsx (Step 1 — Required):**
    - Municipality details form:
      - Full Name (pre-filled from request if available, editable)
      - Municipality Code (pre-filled, editable)
      - Province (dropdown, pre-filled)
      - Contact Info: phone, email
      - Logo Upload (optional — simple file input with preview, stored in state only)
      - Primary Contact Person name and title
    - Validation: name and code required
    - All fields use shared Input component

    **5. Create InviteTeamStep.tsx (Step 2 — Skippable):**
    - "Invite your team members"
    - Dynamic form rows: Email + Role (dropdown: Manager, Ward Councillor, Field Worker)
    - "Add another" button to add more rows (start with 1 row)
    - "You can always add more team members later from Settings"
    - Skip button: "Skip — I'll do this later"
    - NOTE: Invites are UI-only (no actual email sent — backend not implemented)

    **6. Create ConfigureWardsStep.tsx (Step 3 — Skippable):**
    - "Configure your wards"
    - Simple list-based approach (NOT interactive map — too complex for this plan):
      - Add ward: Name + optional boundary description
      - "Add Ward" button, remove button per row
    - "Wards help route tickets to the right teams"
    - Skip button: "Skip — I'll configure wards later"
    - NOTE: Ward data is UI-only (stored in wizard state, not persisted to backend)

    **7. Create SetSLAStep.tsx (Step 4 — Skippable):**
    - "Set your service level targets"
    - Two inputs with sliders:
      - Response Time Target: slider from 1h to 72h (default: 24h)
      - Resolution Time Target: slider from 1 day to 30 days (default: 7 days)
    - Visual: show current values prominently with units
    - "You can adjust these anytime in Settings"
    - Skip button: "Use defaults"
    - NOTE: SLA data is UI-only (stored in wizard state)

    **8. Create CompletionStep.tsx (Step 5):**
    - Celebration screen: "Your Dashboard is Ready!"
    - Optional GSAP/CSS confetti or celebration animation (simple — maybe scale-in of a check icon with glow)
    - Summary of what was configured:
      - Municipality name and code
      - N team members invited (or "None yet")
      - N wards configured (or "None yet")
      - SLA targets (or "Using defaults")
    - CTA: "Go to Dashboard" → navigates to /
    - Check useReducedMotion — skip celebration animation if true

    **9. Add route in App.tsx:**
    - Add route: `/onboarding` → OnboardingWizardPage (authenticated only)
    - This route is accessible after first login or from settings

    **Build verification:**
    Run `cd frontend-dashboard && npm run build` to verify everything compiles.
