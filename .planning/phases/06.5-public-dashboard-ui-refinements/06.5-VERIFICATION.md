| 4 | Gap between Municipal Service Management card and login card is 50% larger | ✓ VERIFIED | LoginPage.tsx line 360: gap 11.25% (50% increase from 7.5%) |
| 5 | Request Access page header title is visible | ✓ VERIFIED | RequestAccessPage.tsx lines 548-556: gold-teal gradient title |

| 7 | Province selector has glossy white tint background with visible text | ✓ VERIFIED | RequestAccessPage.tsx lines 583-601: glassmorphic select |
| 8 | Submit Request button styled like View Dashboard CTA | ✓ VERIFIED | RequestAccessPage.tsx lines 479-496 + App.css lines 430-434 |

**Score:** 8/8 truths verified


### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| frontend-dashboard/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx | Dashboard title, yellow links, teal check icons, increased card gap | ✓ VERIFIED | 520 lines, substantive implementation with all required styling |
| frontend-dashboard/src/pages/RequestAccessPage.tsx | Visible header, yellow labels, styled province selector, CTA button | ✓ VERIFIED | 720 lines, substantive implementation with glassmorphism |
| frontend-dashboard/src/App.css | Province selector glassmorphism, submit button CTA styling | ✓ VERIFIED | Contains all required CSS overrides and styling rules |

**All artifacts exist, are substantive (not stubs), and properly wired.**

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|----|--------|---------|
| LoginPage.tsx | design-tokens.css | Uses --color-accent-gold for yellow link buttons | ✓ WIRED | Line 504 references var(--color-accent-gold) |
| RequestAccessPage.tsx | App.css | Province select uses new glassmorphism class | ✓ WIRED | Line 355 className="province-select" styled in App.css |

**All key links verified and wired correctly.**

### Requirements Coverage

No specific requirements mapped to this sub-phase (06.5 is a polish phase between Phase 6 and Phase 7).

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| RequestAccessPage.tsx | 581 | Inline style color overridden by CSS important | ℹ️ Info | Intentional design to avoid modifying shared Input component |

**No blocker or warning anti-patterns found.**

### Human Verification Required

#### 1. Visual Appearance - Login Page Title Header

**Test:** Navigate to /login on the municipal dashboard and check the login card.

**Expected:**
- Title "Sign in to access your dashboard" visible at top of login card
- Centered with proper spacing (1.25rem margin-bottom)
- Font size 1.25rem with 600 font weight

**Why human:** Visual appearance and spacing can only be verified in browser.

#### 2. Visual Appearance - Link Button Colors

**Test:** On /login page, check the color of link buttons (Sign in with Phone OTP, Request Access, etc).

**Expected:**
- All link buttons should be gold/yellow color (--color-accent-gold)
- Links should have underline text-decoration
- Color should NOT be teal/green

**Why human:** Color perception requires visual verification in browser with design tokens loaded.


#### 3. Visual Appearance - Check Mark Icons

**Test:** On /login page, look at the feature list in the "Municipal Service Management" product info card.

**Expected:**
- Check marks should be teal colored text (✓ character)
- Should NOT have green circle background
- Check marks should match the style on the public about page

**Why human:** Visual comparison between pages to ensure consistency.

#### 4. Visual Spacing - Card Gap

**Test:** On /login page (desktop viewport >768px), measure the gap between product info card and login card.

**Expected:**
- Gap should be 11.25% of the container width
- Gap should feel noticeably larger than before
- Cards should have breathing room between them

**Why human:** Visual spacing perception and comparison to previous state.

#### 5. Visual Appearance - Request Access Header Visibility

**Test:** Navigate to /request-access page.

**Expected:**
- "Request Municipal Access" title clearly visible
- Title has gold-to-teal gradient (gold on left, teal on right)
- Title does NOT blend into pink skyline background (high contrast)

**Why human:** Gradient visibility and contrast on complex background.

#### 6. Visual Appearance - Request Access Form Labels

**Test:** On /request-access page, inspect the form field labels.

**Expected:**
- All labels should be gold/yellow color (--color-accent-gold)
- Includes all form fields (Municipality Name, Province, Contact Person, etc)
- Labels from Input component should also be gold (CSS override working)

**Why human:** CSS important override may behave differently across browsers.

#### 7. Visual Appearance - Province Selector Glassmorphism

**Test:** On /request-access page, click the Province dropdown.

**Expected:**
- Select element has white frosted glass appearance (blur effect visible)
- Dropdown arrow is gold color
- Text is clearly readable
- Options (when dropdown opens) have pink background

**Why human:** Glassmorphism effects may render differently across browsers.

#### 8. Visual Appearance - Submit Button CTA Styling

**Test:** On /request-access page, inspect the "Submit Request" button.

**Expected:**
- Button has gold background (--color-accent-gold)
- Text is dark (#333)
- Button has subtle glow effect
- On hover: button rises slightly and glow intensifies
- Disabled state: 60% opacity and not-allowed cursor

**Why human:** Glow effects, hover animations, and color contrast need visual verification.


#### 9. Cross-Browser Compatibility - Glassmorphism

**Test:** Test /request-access page in Safari, Firefox, Chrome, and Edge.

**Expected:**
- Province selector glassmorphism (backdrop-filter) works in all browsers
- If backdrop-filter unsupported, fallback background still visible
- Custom dropdown arrow SVG renders correctly

**Why human:** Backdrop-filter support varies by browser, needs cross-browser testing.

#### 10. Mobile Responsiveness - Login Product Info Hide

**Test:** Resize browser to mobile viewport (<768px width) and visit /login.

**Expected:**
- Product info card ("Municipal Service Management") is hidden (display: none)
- Only login card visible
- Card centered and readable
- All login functionality works

**Why human:** Mobile media query behavior needs device/viewport testing.

### Gaps Summary

No gaps found. All 8 must-have truths verified in code. All artifacts exist, are substantive, and properly wired. Human verification recommended for visual appearance, cross-browser compatibility, and mobile responsiveness, but no automated verification gaps detected.
