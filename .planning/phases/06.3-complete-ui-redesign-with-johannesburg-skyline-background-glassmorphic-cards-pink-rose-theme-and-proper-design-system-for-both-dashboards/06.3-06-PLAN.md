<objective>
Verify both frontend apps build cleanly and present the re-skinned UI for visual approval.

Purpose: This is the final quality gate — ensure no broken imports, no stale navy references, and confirm the visual result matches the user's intent from the design reference.

Output: Both apps build with zero errors. Visual checkpoint confirms pink/rose theme is correct.

  <name>Task 1: Build verification and color audit</name>
  <files>frontend-public/src/App.css, frontend-dashboard/src/App.css, shared/design-tokens.css</files>
  <action>
**Step 1: Build both frontend apps**
```bash
cd frontend-public && npm run build
cd frontend-dashboard && npm run build
```
Both must complete with zero errors. If TypeScript errors occur from removed Globe/Ndebele imports, fix them.

**Step 2: Color audit — search for navy remnants**
Search all CSS and TSX files for navy color references that should have been replaced:
```bash
grep -rn "0A0E1A\|131829\|1A1F3A\|color-navy\|#0A0\|rgba(10, 14, 26" frontend-public/src/ frontend-dashboard/src/ shared/
```
This should return zero results. If any found, fix them.

**Step 3: Verify Globe3D and NdebelePattern removal is complete**
```bash
grep -rn "Globe3D\|Globe3DSmall\|GlobeLoadingSkeleton\|NdebelePattern\|ndebele" frontend-public/src/ frontend-dashboard/src/ shared/
```
Should return zero results.

**Step 4: Verify skyline assets exist**
```bash
ls frontend-public/public/assets/skyline.png
ls frontend-dashboard/public/assets/skyline.png
```
Both must exist.

**Step 5: Fix any remaining issues found in steps 2-4**
If hardcoded navy colors are found in inline styles within TSX files, replace them with appropriate CSS variables.
If any leftover imports are found, remove them.

  <name>Task 2: Visual verification of pink/rose re-skin across both dashboards</name>
  <files>frontend-public/src/App.css, frontend-dashboard/src/App.css</files>
  <action>
Present the re-skinned UI for visual approval. Start both dev servers and verify:

What was built:
- Pink/rose (#cd5e81) dominant background replaces navy dark mode entirely
- Johannesburg skyline photograph on: public landing hero (with GSAP scroll fade), municipal login, register, and request access pages
- Pink border frame from reference image as literal UI element
- Glassmorphic cards with mixed tint (white frost default, pink frost elevated) and mixed blur (subtle/medium)
- Gold accent (#ffd54f) replaces coral for CTAs, links, and interactive elements
- 3D globe removed entirely from both dashboards
- Ndebele geometric patterns removed entirely
- Animated gradient cycles through pink/rose tones
- Both dashboards share identical theme

How to verify:
1. Start the public dashboard dev server: `cd frontend-public && npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:5173 — verify:
   a. Landing page hero shows Johannesburg skyline photograph
   b. Pink border frame is visible over the skyline
   c. Scrolling down fades skyline to reveal solid pink background
   d. All 7 scroll sections have pink/rose theme (no navy remnants)
   e. Header turns pink glassmorphic when scrolled
   f. Footer has pink/rose tones
   g. No 3D globe visible anywhere
   h. No Ndebele geometric patterns visible anywhere
3. Navigate to /dashboard — verify transparency dashboard has pink/rose theme
4. Navigate to /about — verify about page has pink/rose theme
5. Navigate to /report — verify report redirect page has pink/rose theme
6. Navigate to /citizen — verify citizen portal has pink/rose theme
7. Start the municipal dashboard: `cd frontend-dashboard && npm run dev`
8. Open http://localhost:5174 — verify:
   a. Login page shows Johannesburg skyline with glassmorphic login card floating over it
   b. Pink border frame is visible
   c. Click "Request Access" — verify skyline background with glassmorphic form
   d. Login to dashboard — verify pink/rose theme throughout
   e. Check tables, charts, sidebar — all use pink/rose tokens
   f. No 3D globe visible anywhere
9. Compare both dashboards side by side — should have identical brand identity
  </action>
  <verify>User types "approved" or describes issues to fix.</verify>
  <done>User confirms pink/rose re-skin looks correct across all pages in both dashboards.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Both apps build with zero errors
2. No navy remnants in codebase
3. User approves visual result
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Both `npm run build` commands exit with code 0
- User visually confirms pink/rose theme is correct across all pages
- Both dashboards share identical visual identity
- Skyline, pink border, glassmorphism, gold accents all present and correct
</success_criteria>
