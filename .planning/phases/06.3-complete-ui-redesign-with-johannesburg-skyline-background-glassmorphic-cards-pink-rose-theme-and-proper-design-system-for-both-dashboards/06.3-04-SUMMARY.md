# Phase 06.3 Plan 04: Re-skin App.css for Pink/Rose Theme Summary

**One-liner:** Replaced all navy hardcoded colors with pink/rose theme and coral accents with gold across entire frontend-public App.css

## What Was Built

Complete visual re-skin of frontend-public/src/App.css:
- **Header**: Transparent pink start state, deep rose glassmorphic scrolled state, gold logo gradient and nav underlines
- **Footer**: Deep rose background, gold emergency numbers and link hovers
- **Mobile menu**: Deep rose overlay with gold nav link hovers
- **Landing sections**: Gold/teal gradient backgrounds, gold feature icons and list bullets
- **CTA buttons**: Gold backgrounds with dark text, gold hover glows
- **About page**: Gold/teal gradient hero background
- **Report page**: Gold accent bullets
- **Citizen portal**: Gold GBV emergency section, teal filter tabs
- **Heatmap**: Teal slider with updated glow values
- **Form inputs**: Teal focus states, warm red error states for pink background readability
- **Cards**: Renamed `.card-glow-coral` to `.card-glow-gold`

## Tasks Completed

| Task | Description | Commit | Files |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Re-skin header, footer, and mobile menu for pink/rose theme | 0751d2d | frontend-public/src/App.css |
| 2 | Re-skin all landing page sections and remaining pages for pink/rose | 53d297c | frontend-public/src/App.css |

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. All navy colors removed, all coral accents replaced with gold, all gradient backgrounds updated to gold/teal on pink.

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Header scrolled state**: Used `rgba(163, 72, 102, 0.92)` for deep rose with slight translucency to maintain glassmorphic effect
2. **Gold accent color**: Consistently used `var(--color-accent-gold)` throughout for hover states, underlines, icons, and bullets
3. **CTA buttons**: Changed text color from white to `#333` (dark) for better contrast on gold background
4. **Error states**: Shifted from coral to warm red `#ff5252` for better visibility on pink backgrounds
5. **Gradient backgrounds**: All section gradients now use `rgba(255, 213, 79, 0.08)` (gold) and `rgba(0, 191, 165, 0.08)` (teal) for subtle overlay effects on pink

## Verification Results

**All checks passed:**
- Zero matches for `0A0E1A` or `131829` (navy hex codes)
- Zero matches for `rgba(10, 14, 26, ...)` (hardcoded navy)
- Zero matches for `color-navy` or `color-navy-light`
- Zero matches for `color-coral` (replaced with `color-accent-gold`)
- Header scrolled state uses pink glassmorphism
- Footer uses pink-toned background
- All CTAs use gold accent
- Mobile menu overlay is deep rose

## Files Changed

### Modified
- `frontend-public/src/App.css` - Complete pink/rose re-skin with 43 color replacements

## Impact Assessment

**User-facing changes:**
- Public dashboard now has cohesive pink/rose visual identity across all pages
- Header/footer match the new brand theme
- Gold accents provide better readability than coral on pink backgrounds
- All interactive elements (buttons, links, form fields) use consistent pink/rose/gold/teal palette

**No breaking changes** - This is purely a visual CSS update. No HTML structure, component logic, or design tokens were modified.

## Next Steps

Recommended follow-ups:
1. Test all public dashboard pages in browser to verify visual consistency
2. Verify accessibility contrast ratios for gold-on-pink and dark-text-on-gold
3. Consider adding pink-tinted loading skeletons to match new theme
4. Update any remaining hardcoded colors in component-specific CSS files
