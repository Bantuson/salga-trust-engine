# Phase 6.3: Complete UI Redesign - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Complete visual identity overhaul for both dashboards: replace navy dark mode with pink/rose (#cd5e81) dominant background, use the Johannesburg skyline photograph as hero imagery, refine glassmorphic card system for the new color palette, remove 3D globe and Ndebele patterns, and ensure both apps share an identical theme. All existing page structure and functionality stays — this is a re-skin, not a restructure.

## Implementation Decisions

### Skyline imagery
- Use the exact `design-references/background+pink-border.png` image as hero section background
- Keep the pink border from the reference as a literal UI element (not just mockup decoration)
- Skyline appears on: public landing hero, municipal dashboard login page, Request Municipal Access page
- Landing page scroll behavior: skyline fades out to reveal solid #cd5e81 behind it (GSAP fade transition)
- Other pages beyond the three above use solid #cd5e81 background (no skyline)

### Pink/rose theme
- #cd5e81 is the **background dominant** color — replaces navy dark mode (#0A0E1A) entirely
- Navy dark mode is gone across both dashboards, login, all pages — full removal
- Text is light (not full white) against the pink/rose background
- Animated gradient kept but adapted to pink/rose tones (cycle through #cd5e81 → lighter rose → deeper magenta)
- Buttons, links, hover states, and accents need new colors that read well on pink background (Claude's discretion on specific accent palette)

### Glassmorphic refinement
- Mixed tint approach: some cards get white frost (rgba(255,255,255,0.1-0.2)), some get pink-shifted frost (rgba(205,94,129,0.15)) — no neutral gray
- Mixed blur levels: some subtle (8-12px), some medium (16-24px) — no heavy blur (32px+)
- All glassmorphic cards get thin white border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.2)
- Ndebele/Zulu geometric pattern accents are **removed entirely** — skyline + pink identity is sufficient
- Claude assigns tint and blur per card variant (default/elevated/interactive) as appropriate

### Dashboard visual parity
- Both dashboards (frontend-public/ and frontend-dashboard/) use **identical theme** — one unified brand
- 3D globe is **removed entirely** from both dashboards — it clashes with the skyline background
- Landing page keeps all 7 scroll storytelling sections, re-skinned with pink/rose theme and skyline hero
- Municipal login: Johannesburg skyline background with glassmorphic login card floating over it
- Request Municipal Access page: same skyline background treatment as login

### Claude's Discretion
- Specific accent/secondary colors that complement #cd5e81 for buttons, links, and interactive states
- Exact gradient animation color stops within the pink/rose family
- Which card variant (default/elevated/interactive) gets white frost vs pink-shifted frost
- Which card variant gets subtle blur vs medium blur
- Loading skeleton colors adapted for pink background
- Chart/visualization color palettes (Recharts) adapted for pink theme
- Responsive image handling for the skyline on different screen sizes

## Specific Ideas

- The exact reference image is `design-references/background+pink-border.png` — Johannesburg CBD with jacaranda trees, Hillbrow Tower, warm pink/rose palette
- The pink border in the reference should appear as a literal framing element in the UI
- Skyline fades out on scroll (not parallax, not hard cut) — content scrolls into solid pink
- Text should be light but not pure white — a soft off-white or warm light tone for readability
- Cards should feel varied: mix of white frost and pink frost, mix of subtle and medium blur, but all with consistent thin white borders
